    "Run a local Liveblocks dev server for multiplayer development and testing
    without hitting production."
---

The Liveblocks dev server is a local server that lets you develop and test
multiplayer features without connecting to Liveblocks production servers. It is
built on our open-source
[`@liveblocks/server`](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/tree/main/packages/liveblocks-server)
package internally.

## Features

The dev server fully supports all
[Multiplayer](/docs/ready-made-features/multiplayer) features, and partially
supports other APIs. [Learn more](#Partially-supported-features).

## Set up the dev server

The development server currently only supports connecting with
[public key](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#createClientPublicKey) or
[access token](/docs/authentication/access-token) authentication. ID token
authentication will be supported in future.

<Steps>

  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Install Bun</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      The Liveblocks dev server requires [Bun](https://bun.sh/) to be installed.

      ```bash
      npm install -g bun
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Run the dev server</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      Start the dev server from your project directory—it runs on [`http://localhost:1153`](http://localhost:1153).

      ```bash
      npx liveblocks dev
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Connect to the dev server</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>
      Point your client and auth endpoint to the dev server. The easiest way to
      do this is run the dev server and press `p`. It copies a prompt you can 
      paste into your AI code editor, which will intelligently make the changes
      for you.

      If you don’t use the prompt, you can manually add `baseUrl` and change
      your `secret` key:

      ```tsx
      import { LiveblocksProvider } from "@liveblocks/react";

      function App() {
        return (
          <LiveblocksProvider
            // +++
            baseUrl="http://localhost:1153"
            // +++
            authEndpoint="/api/liveblocks-auth"
          >
            {/* Your app */}
          </LiveblocksProvider>
        );
      }
      ```

      ```ts
      import { Liveblocks } from "@liveblocks/node";

      const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({
        // +++
        baseUrl: "http://localhost:1153",
        secret: "sk_localdev",
        // +++
      });
      ```

      ```tsx isCollapsable isCollapsed title="Alternate snippet for public key"
      // Only edit this file for public key
      import { LiveblocksProvider } from "@liveblocks/react";

      function App() {
        return (
          <LiveblocksProvider
            // +++
            baseUrl="http://localhost:1153"
            publicApiKey="pk_localdev"
            // +++
          >
            {/* Your app */}
          </LiveblocksProvider>
        );
      }
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step lastStep>
    <StepTitle>Complete</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      You're all set up, open your app and start building collaborative features
      using the local dev server, or [set up CI testing](/docs/guides/how-to-set-up-continuous-integration-ci-testing)
      with your application.

## Partially supported features

A number of unsupported features are partially implemented so you can run your
app without seeing errors. For example, `useThreads` is not supported yet, but
it will always return an empty array so you can still view your application.

```tsx title="React"
// ✅ Fully supported
const others = useOthers();
const shapes = useStorage((root) => root.shapes);

// ⚠️ Returns dummy data such as empty arrays
const { threads } = useThreads();
const { inboxNotifications } = useInboxNotifications();

// ⚠️ Nothing happens when calling unsupported functions
const createNewThread = useCreateThread();
createNewThread({ body: {}, attachments: [] });
```

```ts title="Node.js"
// ✅ Fully supported
const storage = await liveblocks.getStorageDocument("my-room-id");
await liveblocks.broadcastEvent("my-room-id", { type: "REFRESH" });

// ⚠️ Room APIs are supported but permissions and metadata are ignored
await liveblocks.createRoom("my-new-room-id", {
  defaultAccesses: ["room:write"],
  metadata: { title: "My title" },
});
// { metadata: {}, defaultAccesses: [], ... }
await liveblocks.getRoom("my-new-room-id");

// ⚠️ Returns dummy data such as empty arrays
const { data: threads } = await liveblocks.getThreads({
  roomId: "my-room-id",
});

// ⚠️ Nothing happens when calling unsupported functions
await liveblocks.createThread({
  roomId: "my-room-id",
  body: {},
});
```

In future, we plan to support more features in the dev server.

## REST API

The REST API supports the same set of features as the Node.js package. To use
it, point your requests to the dev server URL and use `sk_localdev` as the
secret key.

```bash
curl http://localhost:1153/v2/* \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer sk_localdev'
```

## Continuous Integration (CI) testing

You can use the dev server in CI environments by setting up a test environment
file and running the dev server as a service container. Learn more in our guide
on
[how to set up Continuous Integration (CI) testing](/docs/guides/how-to-set-up-continuous-integration-ci-testing).

## Docker

You can run the dev server as a Docker container, which is useful for CI
environments where you may not have Bun installed.

```bash
docker run -p 1153:1153 ghcr.io/liveblocks/cli dev
```

To persist data between container restarts, mount a volume:

```bash
docker run -p 1153:1153 -v liveblocks-data:/app/.liveblocks ghcr.io/liveblocks/cli dev
```

## Source code

The source code is available in our
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/tree/main/tools/liveblocks-cli).
